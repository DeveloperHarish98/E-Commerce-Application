Project Name : E-commerce Application
--------------------------------------

I developed an E-commerce application that enables both merchants and users to create accounts, 

with login and sign-up functionalities. The platform allows merchants to manage product listings, 

while users can browse products, add items to cart and Wishlist, and proceed to checkout. Account 

activation and verification are done via unique tokens sent through email, ensuring secure access. 

The application supports full CRUD operations, allowing users and merchants to update profiles and 

product information. All user and merchant data are securely stored in the database for efficient 

management.

Roles & Responsibilities:

- Worked as a Software Engineer

- Developed Java classes for Model, Controller, Services, DTO, and DAO layers 

- Designed and implemented Repositories, integrating properties to establish and 

access the database.

- Implemented controllers to execute CRUD operations and dispatched verification 

emails for user authentication.

- Engaged in software development, bug fixing, issue resolution, requirement analysis, 

and custom exception handling.
